        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>No Diagnosis:</strong> This tool cannot diagnose any medical condition, illness, or specific needs of your child.</p></li>

        <h2>2. No Warranty or Guarantee</h2>
        <p>We make no claims, guarantees, or warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or effectiveness of the Baby Cry Analyzer tool's predictions or any information presented on this website. While we strive to make the tool as helpful as possible, AI models are not infallible, and individual baby cries can vary widely.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Not "Domestic Tips" or Home Remedies</h2>
        <p>This tool is a technological aid and should not be mistaken for traditional "domestic tips" or home remedies that are passed down through generations. While our blog might contain general parenting advice, the Baby Cry Analyzer tool specifically relies on AI analysis and does not offer traditional or anecdotal solutions. We do not claim that this tool can replace your own parental intuition, observation, or proven soothing techniques.</p>

        <h2>6. Tool Limitations</h2>
        <p>The Baby Cry Analyzer's accuracy is dependent on various factors, including the quality of the audio input (e.g., absence of background noise, clarity of the cry) and the representativeness of the training dataset. Its predictions are statistical inferences and not definitive truths.</p>
