        <h1>Why Do Babies Cry? Types of Cries & How to Understand Them</h1>
        <p>As new parents, understanding your **baby's cries** can be one of the biggest challenges. Infants can't speak, so crying is their primary way to communicate with the world. But don't worry! In this guide, we'll explore the **different types of baby cries** and their common reasons, helping you to understand your child's needs better.</p>

        <h2>Common Reasons Your Baby Might Be Crying</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the most frequent reasons your baby might be crying:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hunger:</strong> This is one of the most common reasons. Hunger cries often start with a "neh" sound and escalate in intensity.</li>
            <li><strong>Sleepiness:</strong> When babies are tired but can't fall asleep, they might start to cry. This is typically a whiny, irritable cry.</li>
            <li><strong>Wet or Dirty Diaper:</strong> A soiled or wet diaper can make a baby uncomfortable, leading to fussiness and crying.</li>
            <li><strong>Discomfort or Pain:</strong> Issues like gas, tummy aches, or other physical discomforts can cause a baby to cry loudly and continuously.</li>
            <li><strong>Too Hot or Too Cold:</strong> Babies are very sensitive to temperature. Ensure they are dressed comfortably for the environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Attention or Boredom:</strong> Sometimes babies just want attention or are bored and need interaction or new stimulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Overstimulation:</strong> Too much noise, light, or activity can overwhelm an infant, causing them to cry.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Many experts believe there are specific patterns and sounds behind infant cries. While every baby is unique, understanding these general types can help you identify your **baby's cry**:</p>

            <li><strong>Hunger Cry:</strong> Often a short, low-pitched cry that might sound like "neh." May also be accompanied by rooting or sucking motions.</li>
            <li><strong>Sleep Cry:</strong> Typically a whiny, continuous cry that might sound like "owh" or "ahh," and they might rub their eyes.</li>
            <li><strong>Gas or Pain Cry:</strong> Often sharp, sudden, and high-pitched, with the baby pulling their legs up towards their tummy.</li>
