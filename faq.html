        <h1>Baby Cry Analyzer - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our Baby Cry Analyzer tool! We aim to provide quick insights for parents. Here are some common questions about our tool and baby cries in general.</p>
        
        <h2>Is this tool a substitute for medical advice?</h2>
        <p><strong>Absolutely NOT.</strong> Our Baby Cry Analyzer is designed as a supplementary tool to assist parents in understanding potential reasons behind their baby's cries. It uses AI to provide educated guesses based on cry patterns. <strong>It is not a medical device, cannot diagnose health conditions, and should never be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment from a qualified pediatrician or healthcare provider.</strong> If you have any concerns about your baby's health or persistent crying, please consult a medical professional immediately.</p>
        
        <h2>How accurate is the Baby Cry Analyzer?</h2>
        <p>Our tool uses advanced AI algorithms trained on various baby cry samples. While it aims to provide the most accurate predictions possible, AI models are not infallible. The accuracy can depend on the quality of the audio input (e.g., background noise, clarity of the cry) and the specific cry pattern. It's a helpful guide, but always combine its insights with your parental intuition and observation.</p>
        
        <h2>What types of cries can the tool identify?</h2>
        <p>The tool is trained to identify common types of baby cries such as hunger, sleepiness, discomfort (like a wet diaper or temperature issues), burping/gas, and sometimes general fussiness. The specific categories will be displayed in the prediction output.</p>
        
        <h2>Do I need special equipment to use the tool?</h2>
        <p>No, you don't! Our Baby Cry Analyzer is a free online tool accessible directly from your web browser. You can use your device's built-in microphone to record your baby's cry, or you can upload an existing audio file.</p>
        
        <h2>Is my baby's data kept private?</h2>
        <p>Yes. We understand the importance of your privacy. Any audio recorded or uploaded through the Hugging Face Gradio app is processed on their servers according to their privacy policy. We do not store or retain any audio data from your sessions.</p>
        
        <h2>My baby's cry was analyzed, but I'm still not sure what's wrong. What should I do?</h2>
        <p>Parental intuition is incredibly powerful. If the tool's prediction doesn't resonate, or if your baby continues to cry persistently and you are concerned, trust your instincts. Re-evaluate their basic needs, try different soothing techniques, and if you remain worried, <strong>always consult your pediatrician or a healthcare professional.</strong> They are the best resource for personalized medical advice.</p>
